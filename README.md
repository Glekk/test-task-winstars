# test-task-winstars

## This repository contains solutions for the Internship Test Tasks.
- First task is Image classification + OOP task. I have implemented 3 image classification models (for MNIST dataset) based on Random Forest, Feed-Forward Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network. 

- Second task is Named entity recognition + Image classification. I have implemented a pipeline that identifies animal names inside the sentence (using BERT), classifies the image of the animal (using EfficientNet), and checks if the image contains the animal name from the sentence or not.

- There are two folders: Task1 and Task2. Each folder contains the solution for the corresponding task with the README.md file that describes the solution and explains how to run it.
